# SGD Classifier with Logloss and L2 Regularization

This project aims to implement the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) classifier with logloss and L2 regularization, without using the sklearn library. The goal is to build a robust machine learning model for binary classification problems.

## Overview

Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) is a popular optimization algorithm widely used in machine learning and deep learning. The logloss is a commonly used loss function for binary classification problems, while L2 regularization is a technique to prevent overfitting.

## Prerequisites

## Before proceeding with the project, you should have a good understanding of the following concepts:

- Gradient Descent
- Logloss
- Regularization
- Binary Classification
- Implementation

## The implementation of the SGD classifier will involve the following steps:

- Data Preparation
- Initialization of Model Parameters
- Training the Model
- Evaluating the Model
- Data Preparation

The first step is to prepare the data for training the model. This includes splitting the data into training and validation sets, standardizing the features, and converting the target variable into a binary format.

## Initialization of Model Parameters

Next, we will initialize the model parameters, such as the learning rate, number of iterations, and regularization parameter. These parameters will be used to control the training process and prevent overfitting.

## Training the Model
The model will be trained using the Stochastic Gradient Descent algorithm. The algorithm will iteratively update the model parameters using the gradient of the loss function with respect to the parameters.

## Evaluating the Model
Finally, we will evaluate the performance of the model using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The performance of the model will be compared with that of the sklearn library.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the implementation of the SGD classifier with logloss and L2 regularization, without using the sklearn library. By building this model, we have shown how to implement a binary classification model from scratch and understand the underlying concepts of machine learning.
